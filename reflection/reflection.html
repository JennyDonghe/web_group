Interacting with Nasty Nets feels like stumbling into a time capsule built from half-forgotten tabs. The experience isn’t about a single “piece” so much as the strange rhythm of browsing itself—clicking through GIFs, broken embeds, and odd scraps of the early web that somehow add up to a portrait of collective curiosity.

Unlike a polished museum installation, Nasty Nets deliberately looks like an ordinary blog: default fonts, awkward spacing, posts stacked without hierarchy. <mark>That banality is part of the art.</mark> It reminds you how every hyperlink once felt like a tiny adventure, how discovery used to happen through randomness rather than algorithmic prediction.

The interactivity lies in participation. You scroll, click, wander, maybe laugh, maybe get lost; the artists did the same when they made it. Each post is both artifact and invitation—an open browser window asking what it means to be online together. It’s less a finished object than a living network of impulses: boredom, humor, imitation, critique.

In the end, the “artwork” is the act of surfing itself—the motion between pages, the micro-choices, the messy collective of human attention stitched across the web.
